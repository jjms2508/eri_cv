# Juanjo CV


## Welcome! 

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML5 and CSS3.**

The challenge is to build out your cv and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.
## Requirements

- Fork this repo
- Clone this repo

## Submission

- Upon completion, run the following commands:

  ```
  git add .
  git commit -m "done"
  git push origin main
  ```

- Create Pull Request so your TAs can check up your work.

## Instructions

**All your work will happen inside *starter_code* so first enter *starter_code*  and start coding**.
Your task is to build out the projecto to the designs inside `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 

You will find all the required assets in the `/starter_code/src/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.
